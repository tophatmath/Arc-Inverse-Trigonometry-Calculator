# Inverse Trigonometry Calculator (Fraction Input)

A C++ console program that calculates **inverse trigonometric angles (in degrees)**
from a **fractional input (numerator / denominator)**.

This tool is useful for evaluating angles from common trigonometric ratios
(e.g. 1/2, √3/2, 3/5) while practicing numerical input handling in C++.

## Features
- Fraction-based input (numerator & denominator)
- Prevents division by zero with input validation
- Computes inverse trigonometric angles in **degrees**
- Handles undefined cases safely
- Simple and clear console output

---

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (GCC / MinGW / g++)
- Windows, Linux, or macOS
- Terminal / Command Prompt

---

## 🔧 How to Compile

Using **g++**:
```bash
g++ InverseTrigCalculator.cpp -o InverseTrigCalculator
